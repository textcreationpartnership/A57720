            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CIRCUMSTANCES Before and after the SPEECH OF WILLIAM LATE <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſcount
Stafford.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe two Sheriffs with a conſiderable number of Gentlemen on Horſeback went to the
<hi>Tower-Gate,</hi> and there demanded <hi>W. Howard,</hi> late Viſcount <hi>Stafford.</hi>
Between nine and ten a Clock, a Gentleman belonging to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> told
the Sheriffs, that the Lieutenant would wait upon them preſently, and bring the Priſoner to the
Bars; to which the Sheriffs anſwered, that they muſt preſerve the Priviledge and Bounds of
the City: An Officer replied; Sir, we were ordered to draw up two Companies from the Gate to the
Bar, and there you are to receive the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheriffs.</hi> Gentlemen, we will preſerve the Liberties of the City, and are come at the
Gate to demand the Priſoner; whether the Lieutenant will deliver him or no, we demand; and
accordingly he was delivered to the Sheriffs between the Gate and Bars.</p>
            <p>Before the Priſoner came, ſeveral people being upon the Scaffold; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, two that
were appointed to write.</p>
            <p>The Heads-man came up with two Blocks, one old, one new, in a Bag; alſo the Axe covered with a
Cloth. The Block being taken out, the new Block was covered over with black, and laid upon a piece
of black Bays, about two yards and a half long, upon which the Priſoner was to ſtretch
himſelf. Then the Coffin was brought up, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd with two Letters, <hi>W. S.</hi> 1680.
Then <hi>W. S.</hi> came upon the Scaffold, and asked for the Executioner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Here he is.</p>
            <p>Staf. <hi>Have you received money for the Cloaths?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. Then his Man took out a Purſe of five pound, which the H. man objected
againſt, and <hi>W. S.</hi> gave him two Guinnies more.</p>
            <p>His Speech was every word writ; which after he had read to the people, being more than 30000 in
number to ſee Juſtice done upon the Traytor, he turned about, and kneeling down prayed in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> Next he lifted up his hands, ſtanding up, and ſaid,
<hi>I beſeech thee God not to avenge my Innocent Blood upon any man in the whole Kingdom, no not
againſt thoſe who by their Perjuries have brought me here; for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs before Almighty
God, that I never combined againſt the Kings Life, nor any body elſe; but whatever I did was
only to procure liberty for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Diſſenters, and the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Religion:
And as for the D. of</hi> York, <hi>I do here declare upon my Salvation, I know of no Deſign that
he ever had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:50499:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>the</hi> King, <hi>but hath ever behaved himſelf
as a loving Loyal Brother ought to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So now upon my Salvation I have ſaid true all that I have ſaid, and I pray God to have
mercy upon my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he delivered the <hi>Latin</hi> Prayer to the Sheriff <hi>Bethel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which he went round the Scaffold and ſpake to the Multitude thus, <hi>I pray God bleſs
the King, and bleſs you all, eſpecially the Kings Loyal Subjects; for I know you have a good
and gratious King as ever Raigned, God, forgive me my Sins, I forgive all the World, even thoſe
Fellows that brought me here, and I pray God ſend them no worſe Puniſhment then to tell the
Truth, and ſo God bleſs you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then a <hi>Miniſter</hi> applyed himſelf and ſaid, <hi>Sir,</hi> You diſown the
Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which he anſwered with a great Paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, What have you to do with my Religion, however I do ſay, that the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>allows no Indulgences for</hi> Murder, Lying, <hi>&amp;c and whatever I have ſaid is
true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Min.</hi> Have You received no Abſolution. Anſw. <hi>I have received none at
all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Min.</hi> You ſaid, that you never ſaw thoſe Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>I never ſaw any of them but</hi> Dugdale, <hi>and that was at a time, when I
ſpake to him about a Footboy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then his man took off his Perriwig and upper Coat, and with a pair of Sizers cut off the Collar
of his Maſters Shirt, After which <hi>W.S.</hi> lyes down in a white Satin Waſt-Coat, a quilted
sky Coloured ſilk Cap with Lace turn'd up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gave his Watch to a Gentleman, and Crucifix to his Page.</p>
            <p>Having fitted his Neck to the Block, riſe up upon his Knees, and prayed to himſelf, then
takes the Block and imbraced it, Then his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant cut off more of the Linen, in all which time he
ſent up ſhort Prayers, That Chriſt would receive his Spirit, then lying down, and praying
upon the Block, the Sheriff <hi>Corniſh</hi> askt of the Headſman, if he had given him any
Sign, He Anſwered <hi>No,</hi> whereupon <hi>W.S.</hi> roſe up and asked, <hi>what they
wanted,</hi> to which it was anſwered, <hi>What ſign will you give,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>No Sign at all, Take your own time, Gods will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Executioner ſaid, <hi>I hope you forgive me,</hi> he made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I
<hi>do.</hi> Then lying down again, Two of his Servants came with a piece of black Silk to receive
the head; then the Headſman took the Axe in his hand, and after ſome pauſe gave the Blow,
which was cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorly done, ſave the Cutting off of a little Skin, neither Body nor Head when
ſevered ſtruggled to any purpoſe, but only quivered a little.</p>
            <p>After which the Headſman took out the <hi>Head</hi> from the Silk, and held it up to all,
Crying aloud, <hi>Here is the Head of a Traytor againſt the King,</hi> after which the Corps with
the <hi>Head</hi> wrapt in ſilk was put into a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, and all carried to the
<hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This with the Speech was taken by <hi>J. Rous,</hi> who was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by both Sheriffs for that
